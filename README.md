- Lint pull request branch name
- Lint pull request title
- Lint pull request description
- Lint all the things...
- Anything listed in the [pull request object](https://github.com/ewolfe/prlint/wiki/sample-pull-request-object
)

## Motivation

This project was created after working on a team that had poor conventions for pull request titles/descriptions and git branch names.

This tool solves those problems, and more. For example, you can:

- Enforce PR’s to follow a naming convention for titles
- Enforce PR’s to to have certain elements within a description
	- A link to a ticket
	- A link to a dev/qa/staging url
	- An @ mention
- Enforce PR’s to have multiple reviewers before it can be merged
	- Including teams (within an organization)
	- Or just a specific person
- Enforce PR’s to have an assignee before it can be merged
- Enforce PR’s to have a label before it can be merged
- Enforce PR’s to have a milestone before it can be merged
- Enforce PR’s to have comments/commits/additions/deletions/changed files within a certain number range
	- Set a limit on the number of additions/deletions that you can perform within a single PR

It works by reading a configuration file within your project (which consists of regular expressions) and returning a fail/pass status to your pull request. See the screenshots below.

## API

### Keys:

The top level keys are keys that the GitHub API exposes when a pull request is opened, edited, etc.

You can use anything listed in the sample response object here https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#get-a-single-pull-request

To target a nested object, you can use dot notation encoded within the key string. i.e.:

```javascript
{
  "assignee.login": [
    {
      "pattern": "octocat"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Values:

The top level values are where you get to define your validation rules. You can have multiples rules, so we expect an array (even if you only have a single validation rule).

- Each item in the array needs to be an object:
- `pattern:` javascript [Regular Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#Syntax)
  - *Special characters must be escaped*
    i.e. If you want to check for a whitespace, use `"pattern": "\\s"` vs `"pattern": "\s"`
- `flags:` optional array of strings used in the [Regular Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp)
    - For example, this can be used to make your regex case insensitive
- `message`: optional string for customizing the error message on the pull request page
